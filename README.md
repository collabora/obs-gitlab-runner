# OBS GitLab Runner

This is a custom [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) implementation
exposing a custom command language for starting, monitoring, and cleaning up
builds on [OBS](https://build.opensuse.org/), specifically targeting Debian
packages.

## Usage

### Sending Jobs

In order to send commands in a job to the runner, set the job's `tags:` to
include the tag you used during [the deployment](#deployment), e.g.:

```yaml
my-job:
  tags:
    - obs-runner  # <-- set to run on runners tagged "obs-runner"
  stage: some-stage
  script:
    # [...]
```

This will run all the commands inside `before_script`, `script`, and
`after_script` with the runner.

### Supported Syntax

A subset of shell syntax is supported for commands:

- Commands are split at spaces, but parts can be quoted, just like in the shell:
  ```bash
  some-command this-is-argument-1 "this entire string is argument 2"
  ```
- Variable substitution is supported, as well as the `${VARIABLE:-DEFAULT}`
  syntax to use the value `DEFAULT` if `$VARIABLE` is unset:
  ```bash
  some-command $a_variable ${a_variable_with_default:-this is used if unset}
  ```
  The variables are sourced from the pipeline-wide and job-specific variables
  set.
  - A significant departure from shell argument parsing is that **variable
    contents are auto-quoted, thus spaces inside a variable do not split
    arguments**. For example, given `MYVAR=a b c`, this:
    ```bash
    some-command $MYVAR
    ```
    is interpreted as:
    ```bash
    some-command 'a b c'
    ```
    *not*:
    ```bash
    some-command a b c
    ```
    There is no way to use a variable without auto-quoting its contents.

#### Flags

Any flag arguments shown below can also explicitly take a true/false value, e.g.
`--rebuild-if-unchanged`, `--rebuild-if-unchanged=true`, and
`--rebuild-if-unchanged=false`. This is primarily useful to conditionally set
the value for a flag; you can set `SOME_VARIABLE=true/false` in your GitLab
pipeline, then use that variable in a flag value as `--flag=$SOME_VARIABLE`.

### Required Environment

In order to connect to OBS, three variables must be set (generally within the
"CI/CD" section of the settings):

- `OBS_SERVER`: The URL of the OBS instance, e.g. `https://obs.somewhere.com/`.
- `OBS_USER`: The username used to authenticate with OBS (any commits created
  will also be under this user).
- `OBS_PASSWORD`: The password used to authenticate the above username. Although
  there are no places where this value should be logged, **for safety purposes,
  it is highly recommended to mark this variable as *Masked*.**.

### Commands

#### `dput`

```bash
dput PROJECT DSC_FILE
  [--branch-to BRANCHED_PROJECT]
  [--build-info-out BUILD_INFO_FILE=build-info.yml]
  [--rebuild-if-unchanged]
```

This will upload the given .dsc file, as well as any files referenced by it, to
OBS. If any previous .dsc files are present, they, and all files referenced
within, will be removed.

Metadata information on the uploaded revision, such as the revision number,
project name, and package name, will be saved into the file specified by
`--build-info-out` (default is `build-info.yml`). This file is **required** by
the `generate-monitor` and `prune` steps. Do note that, if `--branch-to` is
given, the file will be written *immediately* after the branch takes place (i.e.
before the upload); that way, if the upload fails, the branched project can still
be cleaned up.

##### `--branch-to BRANCHED_PROJECT`

Before starting an upload,
[branch](https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/art.obs.bg.html#sec.obsbg.uc.branchprj)
the package to a new project, named with the value passed to the argument. Any
uploads will now go to the branched project, and `generate-monitor` / `prune`
will both used the branched project / package. This is particularly useful to run
testing builds on MRs; you can create an OBS branch named after the MR's Git
branch, and then builds can take place there without interfering with your main
projects.

##### `--build-info-out BUILD_INFO_FILE=build-info.yml`

Changes the filename that the build info will be written to.

##### `--rebuild-if-unchanged`

By default, if none of the files to be uploaded are new or modified from their
previous versions, this will skip any upload, and thus no build will take place.
`--rebuild-if-unchanged` will modify this behavior to explicitly trigger a
rebuild when no actual upload takes place.

Note that, if `--branch-to` was specified, this will, in practice, never be
triggered: due to the way metadata files are handled, right after a branching
operation, there will *always* be a change to upload.

#### `generate-monitor`

```bash
generate-monitor RUNNER_TAG
  [--rules RULES]
  [--download-build-results-to BUILD_RESULTS_DIR]
  [--build-info BUILD_INFO_FILE=build-info.yml]
  [--pipeline-out PIPELINE_FILE=obs.yml]
  [--job-prefix MONITOR_JOB_PREFIX=obs]
  [--job-timeout MONITOR_JOB_TIMEOUT]
  [--artifact-expiration ARTIFACT_EXPIRATION='3 days']
  [--build-log-out BUILD_LOG_FILE=build.log]
```

Generates a [child
pipeline](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/parent_child_pipelines.html)
for the purpose of monitoring builds that were started from a [`dput`](#dput)
command. An individual monitoring job will be generated for each repository /
architecture combination in the project, with a name of
`MONITOR_JOB_PREFIX-REPOSITORY-ARCH` (e.g. `obs-default-aarch64`). Because this
command needs to read the generated build info file, this should generally be in
the same job as the invocation of [`dput`](#dput). The generated pipeline
file can be included in your main pipeline following the standard GitLab
mechanisms:

```yaml
obs:
  needs:
    - job-that-generated-the-pipeline-file
  trigger:
    strategy: depend
    include:
      - artifact: obs.yml
        job: job-that-generated-the-pipeline-file
```

`RUNNER_TAG` should be the OBS runner's tag; this will be used to run the
generated monitoring jobs on the correct runner. (Unfortunately, the runner
cannot see its own tags, so it is unable fill this in by itself.)

If the parent job that invokes the nested yaml (the `obs` job in the above
example) has any rules to [avoid duplicate
pipelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299409), those rules
should be added to the generated job via [`--rules`](#--rules), otherwise you
may get errors claiming the ["downstream pipeline can not be
created"](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/276179).

After each monitoring job completes, it will save the build log to
`BUILD_LOG_FILE`. In addition, if `--download-build-results-to` is given, the
build artifacts will be saved to the `BUILD_RESULTS_DIR`. These artifacts will
all automatically be uploaded to GitLab.

##### `--rules RULES`

Takes a string containing a YAML sequence of mappings to use as
[rules](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#rules) on the generated jobs.

```yaml
dput-and-generate:
  variables:
    RULES: |
      - if: $$VAR == 1
        when: always
      - when: never
  script:
    - dput [...]
    - generate-package my-tag --rules $RULES
  # [...]
```

##### `--download-build-results-to BUILD_RESULTS_DIR`

After a monitoring job completes, download the build results from OBS to the
given `BUILD_RESULTS_DIR`, and upload it as a GitLab build artifact..

##### `--build-info BUILD_INFO_FILE=build-info.yml`

Specifies the name of the build info file to read. In particular, if a different
build info filename was used with `dput` via
[`--build-info-out`](#--build-info-out), then `--build-info` should be used here
to specify the same filename.

##### `--pipeline-out PIPELINE_FILE=obs.yml`

Changes the filename of the child pipeline YAML.

##### `--job-prefix MONITOR_JOB_PREFIX=obs`

Changes the prefix that will be prepended to each generated job
(`MONITOR_JOB_PREFIX-REPOSITORY-ARCH`).

##### `--job-timeout MONITOR_JOB_TIMEOUT`

Changes the timeout for each generated job, using the [job `timeout`
setting](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#timeout). If not passed, the
timeout will not be set.

##### `--artifact-expiration ARTIFACT_EXPIRATION='3 days'`

Changes the expiration of the build results & logs.

##### `--build-log-out BUILD_LOG_FILE=build.log`

Changes the filename each monitoring job will save the build log into.

#### `prune`

```bash
prune
  [--build-info BUILD_INFO_FILE=build-info.yml]
  [--ignore-missing-build-info]
  [--only-if-job-unsuccessful]
```

If a branch occurred, deletes the branched package and, if now empty, project,
using the information from the build info file. (If no branching occurred, this
does nothing.)

##### `--build-info BUILD_INFO_FILE=build-info.yml`

Specifies the name of the build info file to read. In particular, if a different
build info filename was used with `dput` via
[`--build-info-out`](#--build-info-out), then `--build-info` should be used here
to specify the same filename.

##### `--ignore-missing-build-info`

Don't return an error if the build info file is missing; instead, do nothing.
This is primarily useful if `prune` is used inside of `after_script`, as it's
possible for the command generating the build info to fail before the build info
is written.

##### `--only-if-job-unsuccessful`

Only run the prune if a previous command in the same job failed. This is
primarily useful if `prune` is used inside of `after_script`, to only remove the
branched project/package if e.g. the upload failed.

## Deployment

### Registering the Runner

In order to use the runner, you must first register it with your GitLab
instance. This requires the use of a registration token, which can be obtained
via the following steps:

- Enter the GitLab admin area.
- Navigate to Overview -> Runners.
- Click "Register an instance runner".
- Copy the registration token within.

(Per-group/-project registration tokens can also be retrieved from the CI/CD
settings of the group or project.)

With this token, you can now register the runner via the [GitLab
API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/runners.html#register-a-new-runner).

Example using curl:

```bash
curl --request POST "https://$GITLAB_SERVER_URL/api/v4/runners"  \
  --form description='OBS runner' \
  --form run_untagged=false \
  --form tag_list=obs-runner \
  --form token="$REGISTRATION_TOKEN"
```

httpie:

```bash
http --form POST "https://$GITLAB_SERVER_URL/api/v4/runners" \
  description='OBS runner' \
  run_untagged=false \
  tag_list=obs-runner \
  token="$REGISTRATION_TOKEN"
```

**It is critical that you set `run_untagged=false`,** otherwise this runner
will be used for *all* jobs that don't explicitly set a tag, rather than just
the jobs explicitly targeting the runner.

This API call will return a JSON object containing a `token` key, whose value
is a _runner token_ that is used by the runner to connect to GitLab.

### Docker

Docker images are built on every commit, available at
`ghcr.io/collabora/obs-gitlab-runner:main`. The entry point takes two arguments:

- The GitLab server URL.
- The runner token acquired previously.

Simple example usage via the Docker CLI:

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/collabora/obs-gitlab-runner:main \
    "$GITLAB_SERVER_URL" "$GITLAB_RUNNER_TOKEN"
```

In addition, you can instead opt to set the `GITLAB_URL` and `GITLAB_TOKEN`
environment variables:

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it \
    -e GITLAB_URL="$GITLAB_SERVER_URL" \
    -e GITLAB_TOKEN="$GITLAB_RUNNER_TOKEN" \
    ghcr.io/collabora/obs-gitlab-runner:main
```

### Kubernetes

A [Helm](https://helm.sh/) chart has been provided in the `chart/` directory,
installable via:

```bash
$ helm install \
    --set-string gitlab.url="$GITLAB_SERVER_URL" \
    --set-string gitlab.token="$GITLAB_RUNNER_TOKEN" \
    obs-gitlab-runner chart
```

Upgrades can skip setting `gitlab.token` to re-use the previously set value:

```bash
$ helm upgrade \
    --set-string gitlab.url="$GITLAB_SERVER_URL" \
    obs-gitlab-runner chart
```
